# Pokemon Data APP

this app is designed to allow users to easily search up a pokemon and find data about it.

# Motivation

Help users search up pokemon sprites and data, and hopefully eventually search up other different aspects of pokemon and 
even analyze what pokemon could be used better in different situations and with which abilities

# code style

standard kotlin

# Features

currently very very barebones.
2 super basic UI views which show no data, there is only work being done in the backend.
dummy choice for search as "charmander" currently setup for the URL connection
API is properly called and classes for the JSON data is setup
JSON data is also properly parsed to get the basic sprite of the pokemon.

# API reference

pokeAPI is a free and open API with data for all things pokemon
https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#info

# Tests

current tests have been done with the API to GET the default front sprite for charmander
the url to get the image is logged and is the correct url to acces the sprite
